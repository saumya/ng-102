ng-102
===========
This is the part two of the study of [AngularJS][1]. The first part, [ng-101 is here][2].

Most importantly this project starts from the exact same place where the first project [ng-101][2] left. This project explains the `Modules` concept and separating the whole project to different files.

The project makes it easy to understand all the concepts of [AngularJS][1]. A boilerplate code to get up and get going on [AngularJS][1].          
This project uses the following concepts

 - Module
 - Route
 - Controller
 - Directive
 - Service
 - Partials (Sub views or Views)
 - Code comments are there for hinting of things
 - Making pretty URLs with HTML5 History API (This is commented inside the code)
